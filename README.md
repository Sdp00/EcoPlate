# EcoPlate

EcoPlate is a web-based platform designed to tackle food waste and promote sustainability. It allows users to donate surplus food, find food donations, and help redirect plate waste for use as organic fertilizer by farmers, all while fostering a community-driven approach to sustainability.

With a clean, modern design powered by React and Tailwind CSS, and a robust Node.js backend, EcoPlate is built to reduce waste, support local agriculture, and make food redistribution more efficient and accessible.
